# Process Tracking Service

Your application may involve long-running processes that maintain state. Sometimes, bad things happen to good people and the processes disappear.
This may be due to OOMs, nodes going bad, AWS rebooting your instance. Process Tracking Service (PTS) makes it easy to keep track of processes and
take action when they disappear.
